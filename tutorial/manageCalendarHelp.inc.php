	<p> <strong>Working with the Calendar</strong>
	<p>  There are three calendars, one for each venue: the <strong>Foodbank</strong> calendar, the <strong>Pantry</strong> calendar, and the <strong>Soup Kitchen</strong>   
	Each calendar shows all the persons scheduled to volunteer for each crew on every day of a single week. The calendar automatically shows you the relevant group based on your profile.
